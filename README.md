1. Please, open editor that you like.
2. After that clone this repo by this link 
    https://github.com/voloxatyj/groupbwt_test.git.
3. Check if you have yarn package manager to do this type 
    #yarn -v 
    in terminal.
    If don't. I've recommended, just
    npm install --global yarn
4. Then, just write yarn in terminal, you need to install it globally if you not have
5. To start the program you need type 
    yarn dev 
    in terminal of editor.
6. To test type
    yarn test

Requirements
there are no strict deadlines, but lets keep in touch - if you have any problems or have no free time available for the task, just contact us;
task must be made in JavaScript(ES5, ES6 or ES-next) using node.js. If you're not comfortable with node.js, please use whatever you like;
third party libraries, dependencies, tools, frameworks etc. can be used if seems necessary;
your system must be maintainable:
clear dependencies between separate parts of your code;
system must be both testable and tested (unit tests are required);
code understandable, readable, have a clear flow;
your system must be extensible:
adding new functionality or changing existing one should not require rewriting the system itself or it's core parts;
code must be Airbnb style guide compatible;
minimal documentation should be provided:
how system should be ran (what command to run);
how to initiate system's tests (what command to run);
short description of functionality in more difficult places could be provided in the code itself;
Task
Situation
Bank users can go to a branch to cash in and/or cash out from bank account. There are also commission fees for both cash in and cash out. Only supported currency is EUR.

Commission Fees
For Cash In
Commission fee - 0.03% from total amount, but no more than 5.00 EUR.

You can get configuration from API

For Cash Out
There are different commission fees for cash out for natural and legal persons.

Natural Persons
Default commission fee - 0.3% from cash out amount.

1000.00 EUR per week (from monday to sunday) is free of charge.

If total cash out amount is exceeded - commission is calculated only from exceeded amount (that is, for 1000.00 EUR there is still no commission fee).

You can get configuration from API

Legal persons
Commission fee - 0.3% from amount, but not less than 0.50 EUR for operation.

You can get configuration from API

Rounding
After calculating commission fee, it's rounded to the smallest currency item (for example, for EUR currency - cents) to upper bound (ceiled). For example, 0.023 EUR should be rounded to 3 Euro cents.

Input data
Input data is given in JSON file. Performed operations are given in that file. In each object following data is provided:

{
    "date": "2016-01-05", // operation date in format `Y-m-d`
    "user_id": 1, // user id, integer
    "user_type": "natural", // user type, one of “natural”(natural person) or “juridical”(legal person)
    "type": "cash_in", // operation type, one of “cash_in” or “cash_out”
    "operation": {
        "amount": 200, // operation amount(for example `2.12` or `3`)
        "currency": "EUR" // operation currency `EUR`
    }
}
All operations are ordered by their date ascendingly.

Expected Result
As a single argument program must accept a path to the input file.

Program must output result to stdout.

Result - calculated commission fees for each operation. In each line only final calculated commission fee must be provided without currency.

Evaluation Criteria
all requirements must be met;
code quality - it's maintainability, extensibility, testability; speed of the system can also be considered, but is not as important as other criteria.
Task Submission
You can put the code publicly (in github or similar code control systems) if you want.
